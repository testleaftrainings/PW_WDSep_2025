OOPS in TypeScript :
-----------------

1. Class and Object.
2. Method and properties.
3. Constructor.
4. Accessmodifiers.
5. Encapsulation.
6. Inheritance.
7. Polymorphism.
8. Interface and Abstraction

What is OOPS?
OOPS stands for Object Oriented Programming System. It is a programming paradigm that uses "objects

What is Class and Object??

Class is a blueprint or template to create objects.

Object is an instance of a class.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Properties and Methods
----------------------

property :Informartion of that particular page

method : action performed on that page.

---------------------------------

Real life example of Class and Object, Properties and Methods:

###  What is a *Class*?

A *class* is like a *blueprint* or *template* for creating something.

Think of it like this:
When a car company (like Toyota) designs a new model — say the *Innova* — they first create a *design or blueprint*.
That blueprint has details like:

* The engine type
* Number of seats
* Fuel capacity
* Basic shape and dimensions

But the *blueprint itself is not a car* — it’s just a design or a plan.

class CarInnova {
//properties:Informartion of thst particular page
properties : string

//methods:action performed on that page.
method(){
properties
}
}

let variableNameFeature1 = new CarInnova() // Object creation //variableNameFeature1 is the object


In the above code:

Here, class CarInnova is the *blueprint*.
It tells us what a “CarInnova” looks like and what it can do — its *properties* (features) and *methods* (actions).



🧩 Step 1: What is a Constructor?

A constructor is a special method inside a class that runs automatically when you create an object.
It’s used to initialize the object’s properties (like giving each car its own color, engine type, etc.)


AccessModifiers:

1. public : can be accessed inside and outside of the class
2. protected: can be accessed inside the class as well as the related class --> relationship--> inherit
3. private: not accessible outisde the class --> give permission to access or to rewrite "get" and "set"

4. readonly: constant/final --> cannot change the assigned value
5. static:












faker library installation :

npm install @faker-js/faker
