Notes :
-----


enum:
-----
- Enums are a way to define a set of named constants, making your code more readable and maintainable.


Think of enum like a menu in a restaurant:

Instead of customers shouting random dish names, they choose from the menu (fixed options).

The menu items are the named constants (e.g., Menu.Pizza, Menu.Burger).

You can’t order something not on the menu (compiler error).


Playwright Features:
--------------------

1.Frames :
-------

Definition: An HTML document embedded inside another document using an <iframe> tag. Playwright allows direct interaction with elements inside frames.

Usage: Useful for automating pages that load content inside frames or nested frames.

Syntax:

page.frames()-> frames() method helps to get the collection of frames that is present in a webpage.

page.frameLocator(selector) → Locates elements inside a frame (recommended).

page.frame({ name | url | index }) → Gets the frame object to interact with.
