📝 Keep your physical notebook and pen handy to sketch out ideas and test workflows!

Method Overloading :
------------------

Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but different parameters (different type or number of parameters).

Method Overriding :
-------------------

Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass or parent class.
Examples: Creating multiple forms of behavior from a single interface.

About MCP Server

MCP Server(Playwright Context)
 What is an MCP Server?

An MCP Server (Model Context Protocol Server) is a small program that helps ChatGPT talk to Playwright and run automation tasks outside the chat window.

Think of it as a bridge that connects ChatGPT ↔️ Playwright.

Explanation

MCP server lets ChatGPT run your Playwright tests, read logs, open browsers, or interact with files on your system — safely and in a controlled way.

Without MCP:

ChatGPT can only talk to you

It cannot run Playwright tests on your machine

With MCP:

ChatGPT can run Playwright scripts

View screenshots

Read test results

Help debug failures

Open CLI commands

Even generate new .spec.ts files in your repo

All because the MCP server acts like a messenger in the middle.

Simple Diagram
ChatGPT  <---->  MCP Server  <---->  Playwright / Your Local Machine


ChatGPT doesn’t directly access your system.
Everything goes through the MCP server.

 Why Use MCP with Playwright?

Because it allows ChatGPT to:

✔️ Run Playwright tests (example: npx playwright test)
✔️ Open test reports
✔️ Read or update .spec.ts files
✔️ Read logs, screenshots, videos
✔️ Debug your failures
✔️ Create new Playwright test scripts
✔️ Modify the existing automation framework

All secure, because you control what the AI can access.

🔧 Technical but Beginner Explanation

An MCP server:

Lists what tools the AI can use
(e.g., “runCommand”, “readFile”, “writeFile”)

Exposes only specific safe folders

Defines what commands can be run

Returns results back to ChatGPT

Ensures AI cannot misuse your system

So your Playwright directory may look like:

playwright-project/
   ├── tests/
   ├── pages/
   ├── utils/
   └── mcp-server/    ← your MCP connector


The server tells ChatGPT:

“You are allowed to read tests/, modify tests/, and run npx playwright commands”.

Explnation on working

You say to ChatGPT:

“Run my LoginTest.spec.ts”

ChatGPT → (via MCP server) → Your machine:

Runs:

npx playwright test tests/LoginTest.spec.ts


Your MCP server captures:

Test output

Errors

Screenshots

Then returns them to ChatGPT.

You get:

What failed

Why it failed
