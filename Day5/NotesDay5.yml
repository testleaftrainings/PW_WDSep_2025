Agenda for Day5:
---------------

-Function types.
-Array Methods.


Definitions of Concepts:

-Function types.
----------------------      
- In JavaScript, functions can be categorized into different types based on their declaration and usage, such as 

-> Named function/function declarations, 
-> Function expressions, 
-> Arrow functions, and 
-> Anonymous functions.
-> Callback functions.

-Array Methods.
----------------------
- Array methods are built-in functions in JavaScript that allow you to manipulate and perform operations on array data types, such as adding, removing, or transforming elements within an array.








Sort Method internal mechanism:
-------------------------------

let numberArray = [10, 8, 9, 7];
numberArray.sort((a, b) => a - b);


### ðŸŸ¢ Step 1: Initial Array

[10, 8, 9, 7]
---

### ðŸŸ¢ Step 2: First Comparisons

1. Compare **10 and 8**

   * a = 10, b = 8 â†’ `10 - 8 = 2` (positive)
   * Swap â†’ `[8, 10, 9, 7]`

2. Compare **10 and 9**

   * a = 10, b = 9 â†’ `10 - 9 = 1` (positive)
   * Swap â†’ `[8, 9, 10, 7]`

3. Compare **10 and 7**

   * a = 10, b = 7 â†’ `10 - 7 = 3` (positive)
   * Swap â†’ `[8, 9, 7, 10]`

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Step 3: Next Pass

1. Compare **8 and 9**

   * a = 8, b = 9 â†’ `8 - 9 = -1` (negative)
   * Keep order â†’ `[8, 9, 7, 10]`

2. Compare **9 and 7**

   * a = 9, b = 7 â†’ `9 - 7 = 2` (positive)
   * Swap â†’ `[8, 7, 9, 10]`

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Step 4: Another Pass

1. Compare **8 and 7**

   * a = 8, b = 7 â†’ `8 - 7 = 1` (positive)
   * Swap â†’ `[7, 8, 9, 10]`

Now everything is in order

### Final Sorted Array

[7, 8, 9, 10]

---

Quick Recap:

* `a` and `b` are just **two numbers being compared**.
* The compare function `(a - b)` tells JavaScript whether to swap them.
