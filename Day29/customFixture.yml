Think of a fixture as a “ready-made item” that Playwright gives to every test.

Example:

page → a fixture

browser → a fixture

You can also create your own fixtures, like:

lp → LoginPage object
wp → WelcomePage object
hp → HomePage object
lp → LeadPage object
clp → CreateLeadPage object
vp → ViewLeadPage object


Now your test can directly use:

await lp.login();
await clp.enterMandatoryDetails();
await vp.verifyFirstName();


Without creating class objects again and again1 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1 — Import all page objects
import { LoginPage } from "../pages/01-LoginPage";
import { WelcomePage } from "../pages/02-WelcomePage";
// ... etc


This brings all your Page Object classes into this file.

Step 2 — Create a type (like a structure)
type myFixtures = {
  lp: LoginPage,
  wp: WelcomePage,
  hp: HomePage,
  lp: LeadPage,
  clp: CreateLeadPage,
  vp: ViewLeadPage
}


This is just telling Playwright:

“I am creating fixtures, and these are the types for each one.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3 — Extend the base test
export const test = baseTest.extend<myFixtures>({


This means:

"I want to add my custom fixtures to Playwright’s default test."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4 — Creating fixtures one by one

Example:

lp: async ({page}, use) => {
    const lp = new LoginPage(page); // Create object
    await use(lp); // Give it to the test
