📑 Agenda for Week 07 Day 03: OOPS applied POM 
🎯 Focus: Mastering Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in TypeScript]

📆 13th Nov, Thursday

🕝 Session Highlights

⿡ Recap
Quick review of previous learnings.

⿢Inheritance
Exploring the concept of inheritance for code reuse.
Examples: Implementing single and multilevel inheritance.

⿥POM (Page Object Model)
Design pattern to enhance test maintainability and reusability.
Examples: Creating page classes and using them in test cases.


--------------------------

Inheritance :

1. Single Inheritance :
When a class inherits another class

classA{} // 01-accessModifiers.ts --> Base class
classB extends A{} // 02-accessModifiersPro.ts extends 01-accessModifiers.ts

2. Multilevel Inheritance :
When a class inherits another class which is already inherited from another class

class A{}

class B extends A{}
class C extends B{}

3. Hierarchical inheritance 
 When multiple classes inherits a single class

class A{} // Super class

class B extends A{}
class C extends A{}

4. Hybrid Inheritance
A combination of two or more types of inheritnace (e.x : multilevel and Hierarchical)


5.Multiple Inheritance
When a derived class inherits more than one parent class

Typescript does not support multiple inheritnace using classes.
Can be achieved through interface.

Page Object Model :

POM means:

Each web page (or module) of your application is represented by a separate class,
and that class contains locators and methods that act on that page.



Loginpage --> WelcomePage --> HomePage --> LeadPage --> CreateLeadPage --> VerifyLead
                                      ---> AccountPage --> CreateAccountPage -->
