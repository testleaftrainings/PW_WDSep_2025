📝 Keep your physical notebook and pen handy to sketch out ideas!

Alerts /Dialogs:
---------------

Definition: 
Browser pop-ups such as alert, confirm, prompt, or beforeunload triggered by JavaScript.

Usage: Intercept and handle dialog events to read their message and accept or dismiss them.

Syntax:

page.on('dialog', async dialog => { ... }) → Listen and handle.

await dialog.accept([promptText]) → Accept dialog (optionally providing input for prompts).

await dialog.dismiss() → Cancel dialog.



Event Listeners
--------------
Definition: You subscribe to an event via Playwright's event emitter system.

Usage: Allows multiple listeners for the same event. No overwriting — all registered callbacks run.

Syntax: page.on(eventName, callback) or page.once(eventName, callback)


Window Handling
-------------

Definition: Managing new tabs or browser windows opened by the application (via window.open or links with target="_blank).

Usage: Capture and control multiple pages in the same browser context.

Types:

Sequential Approach
------------------

Wait for the new page after the action that opens it.

await actionThatOpensNewPage();
const newPage = await context.waitForEvent('page');
