📑 Agenda for Week 9 Day 1: POM and Plywright Advanced Features

🎯 Focus: Mastering Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in TypeScript

📆 08th Nov, Saturday

🕝 Session Highlights

⿡ Recap
Quick review of previous learnings.

1. Abstraction
Using abstract classes and methods to define templates.
Examples: Designing partially implemented base classes.

2. Polymorphism
Understanding method overriding and runtime behavior.
Examples: Creating multiple forms of behavior from a single interface.

3. Custom Fixture
Creating reusable test setup using custom fixtures.
Examples: Injecting test data, context, or utilities.

4. Device Emulation
Playwright allows testing on different devices by emulating their characteristics (e.g., screen size, user agent).

Examples: Testing responsive designs on mobile and tablet viewports.

5. Visual Testing
Visual testing ensures the appearance of the UI remains consistent by comparing screenshots to baseline images. 
This approach helps detect unintended layout changes, color shifts, or other visual regressions.

6. Jira Integration
Linking test results with Jira issues.
Automating status updates and reporting.

🕡 Wrap Up / Q\&A

📝 Keep your physical notebook and pen handy to sketch out ideas and test workflows!


1. Interface :
-----------------

- Complete hiding of the implemented.
- 100% abstraction.
- Only unimplemented methods.

Summarize 

- class extends another class
- abstract extends another abstract class
- interface extends another interface
- class extends abstract class
- class implements interface
- class extends abstract class im plemnets interface

We cannot see implementation of your page fixture, context browser in playwright everytging is put in as interface

2. Abstraction
----------------- 

abstract class :

- 0 to 100% abstraction.
- Method signature --> unimplementedmethods
- Implemented methods --> logic 


Method Overloading :
------------------

Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but different parameters (different type or number of parameters).

Method Overriding :
-------------------

Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass or parent class.
Examples: Creating multiple forms of behavior from a single interface.
