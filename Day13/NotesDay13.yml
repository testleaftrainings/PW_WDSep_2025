Frames :
-------

Definition: An HTML document embedded inside another document using an <iframe> tag. Playwright allows direct interaction with elements inside frames.

Usage: Useful for automating pages that load content inside frames or nested frames.

Syntax:

page.frames()-> frames() method helps to get the collection of frames that is present in a webpage.

page.frame({ name | url | index }) → Gets the frame object to interact with.

page.frameLocator(selector) → Locates elements inside a frame (recommended).




Alerts /Dialogs:
---------------

Definition: Browser pop-ups such as alert, confirm, prompt, or beforeunload triggered by JavaScript.

Usage: Intercept and handle dialog events to read their message and accept or dismiss them.

Syntax:

page.on('dialog', async dialog => { ... }) → Listen and handle.

await dialog.accept([promptText]) → Accept dialog (optionally providing input for prompts).

await dialog.dismiss() → Cancel dialog.

Event Listeners
--------------
Definition: You subscribe to an event via Playwright's event emitter system.

Usage: Allows multiple listeners for the same event. No overwriting — all registered callbacks run.

Syntax: page.on(eventName, callback) or page.once(eventName, callback)
