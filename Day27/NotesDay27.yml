🎯 [Focus: Mastering Inheritance Concepts in TypeScript]


📆 [12th Nov Wednesday]

🕝 Session Highlights

⿡ Recap
Quick review of previous learnings.


⿤ Access Modifiers

Understanding public, private, and protected access modifiers.
Examples: Controlling access to class properties and methods.

⿥ Inheritance

Exploring the concept of inheritance for code reuse.
Examples: Implementing single and multilevel inheritance.

🕡 Wrap Up / Q&A

📝 Keep your physical notebook and pen handy to sketch out ideas and test workflows!


Inheritance :

1. Single Inheritance :

classA{}
classB extends A{}

2. Multilevel Inheritance :

class A{}

class B extends A{}
class C extends B{}

3. Hierarchical inheritance 

class A{}

class B extends A{}
class C extends A{}

4. Hybrid Inheritance

A combination of two or more types of inheritnace (e.x : multilevel and Hierarchical)


5. Multiple Inheritance
Typescript does not support multiple inheritnace using classes.
Can be achieved through interface.





What super() Does

When you use extends (inheritance), the child class constructor must call super() first —
because it initializes the parent class (superclass) before the child’s constructor executes.

It ensures all properties of the parent class (eName, eid, ephno, eSalary) are properly initialized before the child (HR) starts doing its own work.

Without super(), you can’t access this inside the child constructor



What is static?

The static keyword makes a property or method belong to the class itself, not to the individual objects created from it.

In the code:

public static eid: string


This means eid is a class-level variable, not an object-level variable.


 In the sample code :
EmployeeSignUp.eid = "eid1234";


You are assigning the value directly to the class, not to each employee object.

So no matter how many objects you create:

const emp1 = new EmployeeSignUp();
const emp2 = new EmployeeSignUp();

console.log(EmployeeSignUp.eid);  // eid1234


✅Both emp1 and emp2 share the same static property eid.

 Why Use static?
1️⃣ Common data for all objects

If you have a property that should be the same for all instances, make it static.
Example:

Company name

Organization code

Application version

Common configuration constants

2️⃣ Access without creating an object

You can use it without new:

console.log(EmployeeSignUp.eid);


No need to do:

emp.eid; // ❌ Not accessible like this

3️⃣ Memory efficiency

It’s stored once in memory (at the class level), not duplicated for every object.
